                    FINAL KEYWORD:::
        1) Function                 2) Class

1) Function ---> NO sub-class can overwrite the final function 
2) Class ---> No inheritance from the final class

::: Abstract classes & functions :::
Abstract classes and abstract functions are not allowed to be instantiated. They must have at least one non-abstract subclass or implementation of an abstract method in order
Abstract keyword is used to create abstract methods and properties.
It cannot be instantiated but it can have subclasses that implement its functionality.

::: Interfaces :::
They are the extension of abstract class ---> all the functions are already abstract
    
::: Generics :::
Generics allow you to write code once, then use it with any type.
This allows for more flexible designs than if we had to specify a specific data type each time.
